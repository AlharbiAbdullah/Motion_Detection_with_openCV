### Webcam Motion Detection project

I used openCV mainly for this project. 

### the Idea: 
- detect motion that happened in the webcam
- If there is any movment I would record the time.
- store that time as CSV file. 

I might add things to this project in the feuture such as: 
- time series visulization 
- show the image beening captured and the time.
